Introduction
=====

In this world, there are givers and takers... and some holders. When a person seeks a new place to live, they may look at a variety of topics. Maybe the median prices of houses, the average household income, or even the parking prices. However, not every person seeking a place is seeking it to live. Those takers I mentioned earlier often comes in the form of criminals and they might look at the exact same metrics, but with a different intention.

**Quick Notes**
1) Due to the nature of money and privacy, money data was harder to come by than expected. But, nonetheless, we found some interesting data sets to look at and apply to our argument. 
2) Why the money focus? Money runs the world, baby. 
3) Initally, we were planning to do something along the lines of just making money and living in a wealthy place, but soon, like many movie characters, turned to a life of crime. It's interesting and fun to look at life through the lens of someone you might not traditionally align with, so we kept at it. 

And shoutout to the first group from last week for the simliar idea.
