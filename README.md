Description and links to the datasets used:

We pondered what would be the best neighborhood to rob based on general cost of living, which implies more big money items to steal. We look at three data sets:

Median House Cost?

What neighborhood is cheapest to park?

Average Household Income?

With those data sets and the analysis thereof, we determine what neighborhood has the highest chance for big money items to steal. That neighborhood can be found in our conclusion.
